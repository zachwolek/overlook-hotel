### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
This project was assigned in Week 11 of Turing Boot Camp, due for presentation in Week 12. This final project concludes "Module 2" of 4 within the Turing program, each "Module" being six weeks in length.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
The learning goal were to demonstrate ability with API requests, namely GET and POST methods for retreiving and storing data while constructing Test Driven Development within JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to demonstrate the understanding of technologies.  We used the tech of JS, HTML, CSS, Webpack, Mocha, Chai, and NPM. 

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
1) Learning to separate DOM related material from Webpack/TDD testing was easily the largest challenge that took place. Understanding this concept took a sizable amount of time to create an architechual design that enabled use of the data through separation of flow. 
2) Balancing studying for the live Final Exam with beginning this project demonstrated a challenge in task management. While a win was felt for balancing each of these needs, admittedly lessons were learned in balancing preparation for each on future projects.
